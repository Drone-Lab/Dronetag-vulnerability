The Drone Scanner App is a complementary application for Dronetag hardware, which is a transmitter.Drone scanner App  has been downloaded 50,000 times on Google Play.

Drone Scanner is an application designed to scan the surrounding environment to obtain data from unmanned aerial vehicles' broadcasts, such as identity and location. It collects data and presents it to users on a map.

Drone Scanner can track all aircraft nearby using the Direct Remote ID standard. It provides real-time data of drones on a detailed map, highlighting specific flight areas. Devices that can be viewed include drones broadcasting remote identification according to the requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Union, as well as devices equipped with a drone tag (an additional transmitter).

## 0x01: Attack Scenario 
The Drone Scanner App receives data packets generated by Dronetag devices mounted on drones, following the Droneid protocol, and displays detailed information about nearby drones on the user's mobile device. 

Attackers can craft such data packets themselves and broadcast them using a transmitter. The app does not authenticate the authenticity of the data packets and directly displays them on the mobile interface.

## 0x02: Vulnerability Impact
- Attackers can launch a flood attack, generating a large number of ghost drone signals, thereby preventing users from identifying genuine drone signals in the app. 
- Attackers can impersonate benign Remote ID signals, concealing their identity and engaging in illicit activities.
  
This goes against the original design intent of Dronetag and poses a security risk, impacting government efforts to regulate and secure unmanned aerial vehicles, leading to safety incidents.

## 0x03: Attack Steps 0x01

- Write code to control the format of WiFi or Bluetooth packets as per requirements and burn the code into a microcontroller with WiFi or Bluetooth modules.
- On the app, detect the ghost drone signal we've set, including Remote ID, drone location, posture, speed, and other information.
